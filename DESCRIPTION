Description: Decorate functions to make them return enhanced output. The
    enhanced output consists in an object of type 'chronicle' containing
    the result of the function applied to its arguments, as well as a log
    detailing when the function was run, what were its inputs, what were
    the errors (if the function failed to run) and other useful
    information. Tools to handle decorated functions are included, such as
    a forward pipe operator that makes chaining decorated functions
    possible.
