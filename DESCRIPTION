Title: Add Logging To Functions
Description: Decorate functions to make them return enhanced output. The
  enhanced output consists in an object of type 'chronicle' containing the
  result of the function applied to its arguments, as well as a log detailing
  when the function was run, what were its inputs, what were the errors (if the
  function failed to run) and other useful information. Tools to handle
  decorated functions are included, such as a forward pipe operator that makes
  chaining decorated functions possible.
