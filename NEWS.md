# chonicler 0.3.0

## New features

- New `write_chronicle_df` function which writes data frames to .csv or .xlsx formats alongside their logs.
- Named arguments can now be passed to functions.
- ggplots can now be recorded as well. If a plot fails, it returns "an error" plot: a red box with the error message shown on it.
  This allows documents that use plots that might need more tweaking to still be compiled.
