\title{Decorates a function to output objects of type \code{chronicle}.}
\usage{
record(.f, .g = (function(x) NA), strict = 2, diff = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{.f}{A function to decorate.}

\item{.g}{Optional. A function to apply to the intermediary results for monitoring purposes. Defaults to returning NA.}

\item{strict}{Controls if the decorated function should catch only errors (1), errors and warnings (2, the default) or errors, warnings and messages (3).}

\item{diff}{Whether to show the diff between the input and the output ("full"), just a summary of the diff ("summary"), or none ("none", the default)}
}
\value{
A function which returns objects of type \code{chronicle}. \code{chronicle} objects carry several
elements: a \code{value} which is the result of the function evaluated on its inputs and a second
object called \code{log_df}. \code{log_df} contains logging information, which can be read using
\code{read_log()}. \code{log_df} is a data frame with columns: outcome, function, arguments, message, start_time, end_time, run_time, g and diff_obj.
}
\description{
Decorates a function to output objects of type \code{chronicle}.
}
\details{
To chain multiple decorated function, use \code{bind_record()} or \verb{\%>=\%}.
If the \code{diff} parameter is set to "full", \code{diffobj::diffObj()}
(or \verb{diffobj::summary(diffobj::diffObj()}, if diff is set to "summary")
gets used to provide the diff between the input and the output.
This diff can be found in the \code{log_df} element of the result, and can be
viewed using \code{check_diff()}.
