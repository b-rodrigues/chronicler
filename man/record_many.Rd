\usage{
record_many(list_funcs, .g = (function(x) NA), strict = 2, diff = "none")

record_many(list_funcs, .g = (function(x) NA), strict = 2, diff = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{list_funcs}{A list of function names, as strings.}

\item{.g}{Optional. Defaults to a function which returns NA.}

\item{strict}{Controls if the decorated function should catch only errors (1), errors and warnings (2, the default) or errors, warnings and messages (3).}

\item{diff}{Whether to show the diff between the input and the output ("full"), just a summary of the diff ("summary"), or none ("none", the default)}

\details{
Functions must be entered as strings of the form "function" or "package::function".
The code gets generated and copied into the clipboard. The code can then be pasted
into the text editor. On GNU/Linux systems, you might get the following error
message on first use: "Error in : Clipboard on X11 requires that the DISPLAY envvar be configured".
This is an error message from \code{clipr::write_clip()}, used by \code{record_many()} to put
the generated code into the system's clipboard.
To solve this issue, run \code{echo $DISPLAY} in the system's shell.
This command should return a string like ":0". Take note of this string.
In your .Rprofile, put the following command: Sys.setenv(DISPLAY = ":0") and restart
the R session. \code{record_many()} should now work.
