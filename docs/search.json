However, curious, read . monad computation device offers two things: possibility decorate functions can provide additional output without touch function’s core implementation; way compose decorated functions; (definition oversimplification actual definition monad, good enough purposes.) understand monad , believe useful explain sort problem monads solve. Suppose instance wish functions provide log ’re run. function looks like : need rewrite function like : two problems implementation: need rewrite every function need use provide logs; functions don’t compose. mean “functions don’t compose”? Consider another function my_log(): sqrt() log() compose, rather, can chained: true my_sqrt() my_log(): my_log() expects number, list my_sqrt() returns. “monad” need solve two problems. first problem, rewrite every function, can tackled using function factories. Let’s write one problem: can now create functions easily: can call l_sqrt() l_log() decorated functions values return monadic values. second issue remains though; l_sqrt() l_log() can’t composed/chained. solve issue, need another function, called bind(): Using bind(), now possible compose l_sqrt() l_log(): bind() takes care providing right arguments underlying function. can check result correct comparing $result value returned object log(sqrt(10)): solution using function factory defining helper function make decorated functions compose constitutes monad, strictly speaking, precisely correct. can interesting see actual definition programming language Haskell, pure functional programming language monads must used solve certain issues: (Source: Monad) definition quite cryptic, especially don’t know Haskell, means Monad (Haskell) something three methods: >>= called bind(); >> didn’t bother implementing, ’s really needed understanding monad ; return. Don’t confused name, nothing return() use inside functions return value. return function wraps (converts) value monadic value, consider object , return takes input returns monadic value m . didn’t implement return (also called unit, also good name), function factory log_it() return/unit’s job returns m f() instead m . Using function factories comes naturally R users using return/unit, hence focus return/unit. Also, using function factory, easy implement return/unit: return/unit just identity() function went function factory. sense, function factory even necessary defining monad return/unit. Finally, might read sometimes monads objects flatmap() method. think definition well strictly correct likely oversimplification. flatmap() anyways? practical terms, equivalent bind(), get ’s different. implement flatmap() two additional functions needed: fmap() flatten() (quite often called join(), nothing joining data frames, used flatten() instead). fmap() function takes monadic value argument undecorated function applies undecorated function monadic value: Let’s first define monadic value: Let’s now use fmap() apply non-decorated function m: Great, now flatten() (join())? useful? Suppose instead log() used l_log() fmap() (’re using decorated function instead undecorated one): can see output, produced nested list, monadic value value monadic value. like flatten()/join() take care us. implementation flatten(): Let’s try now: Great! Now, explained earlier, flatmap() bind() thing. implemented flatten() fmap(), two functions relate flatmap()? turns flatmap() composition flatten() fmap(): means can now replace: : get result (well, quite, since log different). prefer introducing monads using bind(), bind() comes natural solution problem decorated functions composing. flatmap(), applications might easier first define flatten() join() get flatmap() instead trying write bind() directly, ’s good know approaches. continuing final part introduction, just want share lists also monads. everything need: .list() unit(), purrr::map() fmap() purrr::flatten() flatten(). means can obtain flatmap() composing purrr::flatten() purrr::map(): (thanks @armcn_ showing ) sum, monads useful need values also carry something . something can log, shown , many examples. another example monad implemented R package, see maybe monad. {chronicle} actually takes advantage maybe package uses maybe monad handle cases functions fail. provide short introduction maybe monad Maybe monad vignette.","code":"my_sqrt <- function(x){    sqrt(x)  } my_sqrt <- function(x, log = \"\"){    list(sqrt(x),        c(log,          paste0(\"Running sqrt with input \", x)))  } my_log <- function(x, log = \"\"){    list(log(x),        c(log,          paste0(\"Running log with input \", x)))  } 10 |>   sqrt() |>   log() #> [1] 1.151293 10 |>   my_sqrt() |>   my_log() Error in log(x) (from #3) : non-numeric argument to mathematical function log_it <- function(.f, ..., log = NULL){    fstring <- deparse(substitute(.f))    function(..., .log = log){      list(result = .f(...),          log = c(.log,                  paste0(\"Running \", fstring, \" with argument \", ...)))   } } l_sqrt <- log_it(sqrt)  l_sqrt(10) #> $result #> [1] 3.162278 #>  #> $log #> [1] \"Running sqrt with argument 10\"  l_log <- log_it(log)  l_log(10) #> $result #> [1] 2.302585 #>  #> $log #> [1] \"Running log with argument 10\" bind <- function(.l, .f, ...){    .f(.l$result, ..., .log = .l$log)  } 10 |>   l_sqrt() |>   bind(l_log) #> $result #> [1] 1.151293 #>  #> $log #> [1] \"Running sqrt with argument 10\"              #> [2] \"Running log with argument 3.16227766016838\" log(sqrt(10)) #> [1] 1.151293 class Monad m where   (>>=)  :: m a -> (  a -> m b) -> m b   (>>)   :: m a ->  m b         -> m b   return ::   a                 -> m a unit <- log_it(identity) fmap <- function(m, f, ...){    fstring <- deparse(substitute(f))    list(result = f(m$result, ...),        log = c(m$log,                paste0(\"fmapping \", fstring, \" with arguments \", paste0(m$result, ..., collapse = \",\")))) } # Let’s use unit(), which we defined above, for this.
